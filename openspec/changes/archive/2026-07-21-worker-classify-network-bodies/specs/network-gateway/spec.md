# network-gateway delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The gateway classifies a request body in-process and never lets content leave it
The gateway MUST classify the plaintext body of a network request by sending it to the sandboxed
worker to parse — the gateway process MUST NOT link or run the parser itself — and MUST project the
worker's result to a content-free classification carrying only detector type, confidence, and
occurrence count (D10/D29). The body bytes MUST NOT appear in the Event, the Decision, the audit row,
or anything that crosses the process boundary, and a worker error MUST surface as a failure, never a
clean empty result (D17). This keeps the RCE-prone parser out of the network-capable process (D71
closed), while the gateway holds the bytes only long enough to proxy and to hand them to the worker.

#### Scenario: A request body carrying a CPF is classified in the worker without content crossing the boundary
- **WHEN** a network Request whose body contains a valid CPF is processed by the gateway backed by the
  real sandboxed worker
- **THEN** the resulting Decision is an audited ALERT and the classification records the detector type
  and count with no matched text
- **AND** the gateway package does not link the in-process classifier

#### Scenario: A worker error is an auditable failure, not a clean result
- **WHEN** the worker returns an error for a request body
- **THEN** the gateway terminates the request as a failure rather than treating it as no findings
